# Project 9: L'Or√©al Routine Builder with Web Search

L'Or√©al is expanding what's possible with AI, and now your chatbot is getting smarter with real-time web search capabilities. This upgraded routine builder allows users to browse real L'Or√©al brand products, select the ones they want, and generate a personalized routine using AI with access to current information.

Users can browse products, generate AI-powered routines, and ask follow-up questions about beauty topics. The AI now searches the web for current L'Or√©al product information, reviews, pricing, and beauty trends, providing up-to-date responses with links and citations.
